## zh-CN
Edges in `MultiRangeSlider` can be joined in such a way, that two ranges can be changed at the same time. Attaching is executed by using `double mouse click` on an edge or by appropriate method call.

#### Rules:
- if two neighboring edges are in the same spot, they will be treated as both joined
- if two edges are in the same spot but are not neighboring, the will be treated as in separate spots
- cannot join edges of the same range
