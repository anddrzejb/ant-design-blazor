## zh-CN
`MultiRangeSlider` and `RangeItem` contains a number of event callback that allow to control each component's behavior or can be used to observe the changes done to the component. The events that end with "ing" (`OnEgeMoving`, `OnEdgeAttaching`, etc.) return a `boolean` that controls if action should be performed by the component. For example: if `false` is returned for `OnEdgeMoving`, the move will not be performed and data will not be changed.
