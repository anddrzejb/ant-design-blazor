  zh-CN: Equal Overlap (CN)
  en-US: Equal Overlap

## zh-CN
When overlapping is allowed, equal values are not treated as overlapping. That means the component will allow the same ending and starting value for neighboring edges. 

This behavior can be altered by using a combination of parameters:
- `EqualIsOverlap` - will treat values as "taken" 
- `ExpandStep` - visual "unit" will expand to occupy the step fully

A use case: when working with date periods.
